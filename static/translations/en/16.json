  ],

  ],
  [
    77,

    81,
    "And Allah has provided you shade out of what He created, and has given you shelter in the mountains.

  ],

    92,
    "Do not be like the woman who ˹foolishly˺ unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a means of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah tests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make your differences clear to you."
  ],
  [
    93,
    "Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of believers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills. And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do."
  ],
  [
    94,
